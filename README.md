# Heroes of the Storm Replay Statistics
based on https://github.com/barrett777/Heroes.ReplayParser

**Description**

This program creates charts from your replays, e.g. wins/losses per day or how often which hero was played on which map. It uses Barrett777's replay parser to extract the data.


**How to use**

First you need to add replays. Replays are being searched in the standard HotS replay folder. The gathered stats can be saved to a file because loading the stats is considerably
faster than reading the replays. New replays can be added later.

Once replay stats are available the filter elements appear. Replays can be filtered by player name, game type, hero, map, length, date and win or loss.
For the filtered replays charts can be created.
